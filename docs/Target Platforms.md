Platform: ### Gameboy Advance
Summary: 16/32-bit handheld game console. Small, modest processing power by todays standards and comparable hardware to the SNES, it is closer to the bits that make up its games than any modern console.
Development will be difficult, requiring a mix of both C and ARM Assembly knowledge.
