# Headers vs Source files -- Where to put things

Prelude:
- Symbols - These  _declare_  what the variable contains, represents or behaves like. There is no other content present to a declaration.

Headers contain declarations, macros, inline functions, public declarations, and other meta-data.
Source files are what are actually compiled, so they should contain all data, definitions and other materials needed for the program.
